<p style="text-align: left;">
<br>
<p>My interest in electronics began when I was given a breadboard, a resistor, a
LED, and a couple of wires. From there, I've built simple circuits, created two
Arduino projects, and participated in a electric solar car team. I am currently a sophomore
at NC State University, majoring in electrical engineering with an intended concentration
in communication and signal processing.</p>
<br>
<p>Beyond electrical concepts, I love to combine STEM and the arts.
Since my freshman year of high school, I've participated in various roles in technical theatre,
from sound technician to assistant stage manager. I am currently intending to minor
in theatre and I hope to volunteer at my university's theatre company in 2021. My
dream job is becoming a theatre engineer or electric designer for a large theatre company
with my electrical concepts!</p>
<br>
<p>I am also an active member of local Asian American communal spaces. I've previously
served as an executive board member for two Asian organizations, with a focus on cultural
event planning and technical execution.
Through these orgs, I've learned multitudes about teamwork, collaboration, and
cultural passion. Right now, I am interning at
<a href="https://www.ncaatogether.org">North Carolina Asian Americans Together</a> (NCAAT)
<!--and the
 <a href="https://www.pivotnetwork.org">Progressive Vietnamese American Organization</a>
(PIVOT) --> as a 2020 voter engagement intern.</p>
<br>
<p>In my free time, I love to learn web development, play the ukulele, stare at UX designs,
and watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5vtqDuUM1Dl67yQPW2HmHHLTfT8S4-Th">drawing challenge videos</a> on YouTube.</p>
