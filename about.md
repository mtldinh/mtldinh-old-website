<p style="text-align: left;">
<br>
My interest in electronics began when I was given a breadboard, a resistor, a
LED, and a couple of wires. From there, I've built simple circuits, created two
Arduino projects, and was in a electric solar car team. I am currently a sophomore
at NC State University, majoring in electrical engineering with an intended concentration
in communication and signal processing.
<br>
Beyond electrical concepts, I love to marry STEM and the arts.
Since my freshman year of high school, I've participated in various roles in technical theatre,
from sound technician to assistant stage manager. I am currently intending to minor
in theatre and I hope to volunteer at my university's theatre company in 2021. My
dream job is becoming a theatre engineer or electric designer for a large theatre company
with my electrical concepts!
<br>
I am also an active member of local Asian American communal spaces. I've previously
served as an executive board member for two Asian organizations, focusing on
cultural event organization.
Through these orgs, I've learned multitudes about teamwork, collaboration, and
cultural passion. Right now, I am interning at
<a href="ncaatogether.org">North Carolina Asian Americans Together</a> (NCAAT)
and the
<a href="pivotnetwork.org">Progressive Vietnamese American Organization</a>
(PIVOT) as a 2020 voter engagement fellow.
<br>
In my free time, I love to learn web development, play the ukulele, stare at UX designs,
and watch drawing challenge videos on YouTube.
